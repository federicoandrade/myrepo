```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Pipe operator
It has a short cut that is CTRL +Shift +M
It takes what its to the left of the pipe and applies the functions to the right. You can see the pipe operator as a "gets" or "then". 

```{r pipeoperator}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
gapminder %>% head()



```

## Using select

Back do dplyr

```{r select}
select(gapminder, year, lifeExp)
```

Same operation but written with pipe. Also, two ways of getting to the ssame result with typical R and pipes
```{r pipelineselect}
gapminder %>% 
  select(year, lifeExp) %>% 
  head(4)

gapminder[gapminder$country == "Cambodia", c("country", "year")]


gapminder %>% filter(country=="Cambodia") %>% select(year, lifeExp)

```
